## Overview

C++ Module 09 focuses on the practical use of STL containers, iterators, and algorithms. Through these exercises, you will deepen your understanding of data structure manipulation and algorithm application.

## Learning Objectives

This module aims to:
- Develop proficiency with STL containers and their various operations
- Master the use of iterators to navigate through data structures
- Apply STL algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently
- Understand time and space complexity considerations in algorithm selection
- Gain practical experience in parsing and processing different data formats

## Exercises

This module includes the following exercises:

- **ex00: Bitcoin Exchange**
  - Read and parse data from CSV files
  - Implement a system to calculate exchange rates based on historical data
  - Handle error cases and edge conditions in financial data processing

- **ex01: RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)**
  - Implement a calculator using the postfix notation system
  - Apply stack data structures for expression evaluation
  - Process command-line arguments efficiently

- **ex02: PmergeMe**
  - Implement the merge-insert sort algorithm (Ford-Johnson algorithm)
  - Compare performance between different STL containers (std::vector and std::list/std::deque)
  - Measure and analyze algorithm execution time

## Compilation

Each exercise can be compiled using the following commands:

```bash
cd exXX
make
```

## Usage
